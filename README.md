# 🏥 AS Pharmacy — Medical Store Automation System

A complete, full-stack pharmacy management system that digitizes the day-to-day operations of a medical store — from inventory tracking and billing to sales analytics and AI-powered health assistance.

---

## 📖 Overview

AS Pharmacy automates the complete workflow of a medical store. When a customer requests a medicine, staff can instantly search the inventory, generate an accurate bill with discounts, and complete the transaction — while the system maintains a centralized, real-time record of every sale. Pharmacy owners (Admins) can securely monitor their business — sales, revenue, and stock — from anywhere, at any time.
